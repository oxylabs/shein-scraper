Oxylabsâ€™ [Shein Scraper](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/ecommerce/shein?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repositories&utm_campaign=product) (a part of Web Scraper API) is a data gathering solution allowing you to extract real-time information from an Shein website effortlessly. This brief guide explains how an Shein Scraper works and provides code examples to understand better how you can use it hassle-free.

### How it works

You can get Shein results by providing your own URLs to our service. We can return the HTML, parsed JSON, or Markdown output for any Shein page you like.

#### Python code example

The example below illustrates how you can get HTML of Shein page.

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint

# Structure payload.
payload = {
    'source': 'universal',
    'url': 'https://m.shein.com/eur/kids?lang=en&ref=m&rep=dir&ret=meur'
}

# Get response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('user', 'pass1'),
    json=payload,
)

# Instead of response with job status and results url, this will return the
# JSON response with the result.
pprint(response.json())
```
